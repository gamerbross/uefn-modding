# Cracked UEFN

Cracked UEFN allows you to get access to every single file, including plugins and C++, and almost no restrictions.

## How to load it?
Open a PowerShell window, type this
```powershell
& 'C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Fortnite\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditorFortnite-Win64-Shipping.exe' -DisablePlugins=ValkyrieFortnite
```
, and hit enter.
If you installed Fortnite in another path than the default, replace `C:\Program Files\Epic Games\Fortnite\` with your game path. (
```powershell
& 'CUSTOM_PATH\FortniteGame\Binaries\Win64\UnrealEditorFortnite-Win64-Shipping.exe' -DisablePlugins=ValkyrieFortnite
```
)
