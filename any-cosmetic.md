# Any Cosmetic
You currently can use any skin, any pickaxe and any emote.

## Skins
There are two methods of using skins:
  - Mystique Method: you need to have the Mystique Skin putted on, kill a guard with the skin that you want, and use the Mystique Emote with a Dance Volume.
  - Emote Method: you need a Emote Controller that gives you an emote that changed your skin, not your skin style.

## Pickaxes
You need a item spawner with the pickaxe weapon and grab it.

## Emotes
Use this [Paste Code](paste-codes/Every%20Emote).
